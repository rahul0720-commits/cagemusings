We are the children of the Sun
We are the reckless 'Youth'
We run wild, free of faun
We don't want the truth

In our eyes, we see the Ocean
In our eyes, the Sea,
Even if the water's frozen,
In our longing to be free

Just tomorrow we will be awoken
To a world incredibly old
To a time, an age, a number, when we are broken
Or a moment to turn into Gold

Many are standing, still in the storm,
Holding the curse of youth,
Each with her own story
Each with her own truth

For some stories will never be spoken,
Some truths never be told,
An age where you are broken,
Or a moment to turn into Gold

No pacts, no fair keeping,
The world is not a a safe heaven,
And I didn't say a thing,
So don't ask my wintervoice for false promises of Spring

But the world is your oyster
Go find your pearls.
Don't be confined to the safelands of a cloister,
Be a hurricane with mellow curls

Go seek the hidden patio
Down the green green lane
The plant of Love grows next to,
The tree of hate and pain.

So take my shaking hands and tear drops,
take them as a token
For you my children of the Sun,
I could also burn.

They will keep you warm and cold,
This is the age you are broken,
Or a moment to turn into gold.
