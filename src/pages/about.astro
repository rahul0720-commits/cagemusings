				<strong>Cage Musings</strong> is a quiet rebellion.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is a place where thoughts that don&rsquo;t fit neatly into conversation are allowed to breathe. Where longing, rage, tenderness, nostalgia, and the unsaid are given language&mdash;sometimes gently, sometimes without permission.
			</p>
			<p>
				I write poetry the way some people pace a room: to understand what is pressing against the walls of the mind. Most of these poems are in English, because that&rsquo;s the language I learned to think in. Some arrive in Hindi, because certain emotions refuse translation and demand to be felt in the tongue they were born in.
			</p>
			<p>
				My writing lives in the in-between spaces&mdash;between strength and vulnerability, detachment and desire, memory and forgetting. I write about love that lingers longer than it should, about loss that doesn&rsquo;t announce itself, about being fiercely self-aware and still undone by feeling. There is softness here, but it is never na&iuml;ve. There is pain, but it is never ornamental.
			</p>
			<p>
				The &ldquo;cage&rdquo; in Cage Musings is not just confinement&mdash;it is consciousness. The awareness of everything we carry quietly while continuing to show up, perform, function, survive. These poems are the musings that happen inside that cage, when the world is silent enough to listen.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is not a curated archive of perfection. It is a living collection&mdash;written over years, across phases, heartbreaks, growth, regressions, clarity, and confusion. Some poems whisper. Some confront. Some simply sit beside you and say, <em>I know.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				If you&rsquo;ve ever felt too much and said too little, you&rsquo;ll find yourself here.
