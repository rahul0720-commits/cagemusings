I went down to the lake,
I saw the Sun, it's hues and flakes,
I felt perched, fixated, lost and naive,
I gasped to breathe, afraid to be brave,

I thought, I sat on the bank,
I tried to be calm, but couldn't,
So I decided and sank,
I tried to drown, but couldn't

Then I saw a glimmering light,
Shining like a knight's Armour,
I felt hope, assurance to fight
I saw my savior, my charmer

As it held me captive in it's lagoon,
I felt vulnerable, fragile and child-like
I opened my arms, deciding without-ado,
My heart racing, shouting like on a mike

I let the frenzy sink in,
The mellow knocks of love and it's sins
I embrace the fear it brings,
I overcome the darkness, to which it clings

To be afraid, is not an option,
The only way forward is through,
Courage potion, happiness, has no concoction,
But only a few have a clue!
