Of all things and feelings,
my only constant is leaving

Of all words, play and art,
my favorite is you, a pointed dart

The horizon merges into the zenith,
the waves of time flips it all beneath

The sun glitters with dust gold,
days are lingering and nights cold

A strong sense of solitude and sadness,
a glorified collection of misery and madness

My words, my ache, you don't understand,
no blames, you are so programmed

Have you ever seen a one-legged dog?
how it fetches the no-bone-log

A scare-crow, just standing in a corn-field,
waiting to do, guarding the seeds

A strong sense of make-believe,
a hollow sensation of relief

Now only comfort I seek,
with poise and posture of a freak!
