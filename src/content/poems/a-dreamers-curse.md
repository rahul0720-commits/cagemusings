If you are a dreamer, come in,

If you are a wisher, a teller, a liar, come in

A hope-er, a pray-er, a magic bean buyer,

If you're a pretender, come sit by my fire

If you weave memories and spin tales, come in,

If you can tell me things I want to listen, come in,

If you can stir the strings of a lost song, come in,

If you can give words to my vague rants, come in,

If you can play my hero, take me on a fairy ride,

If you can just read between my lines,

If you can right my wrongs and wash my sins,

Come in, For we have some flax-golden tales to spin.

Come in!
Come in!
