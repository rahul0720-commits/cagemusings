Falling prey to my cupidity
then searching for joy all along,
These equations of time and sand
like wondering in a hollow land

You think I'm crazy,
crazy is an understatement
Look deeper in my head's mesh
The hymn of haunting, you will see in blood and flesh

A lover's quarrel keeps repeating
Like an eyelet placed in frenzy
These songs, invitations to a smile-coy
Like ghost stories of karma and joy

A memory so faded and still strong
walking on a mountain bed, all gone wrong?
This maze of running in queues,
Ask me your questions, clear my blues...
