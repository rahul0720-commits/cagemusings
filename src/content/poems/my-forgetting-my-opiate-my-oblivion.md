Shh...Don't call me, don't recall me,
My name is the only dress I wear,
Silently adorned by the scarf of scars

My name is the first to go,
Followed in gush by the irony of life's plot,
It's a sob story, why would you ruin your day?
On something you have never read, never even heard of

For every fleeting moment, my memories retire,
The ones I have harbored, the ones I have unwillingly carried for so long
They recede into the southern hemisphere of my brain,
To a little pond by the hills, where there's no pain

Many flights to and fro, I kissed my muse goodbye,
Let the quadratic equation pack its bag and witter and die.

As I count straight on my fingers, memorize the names of the planets, the new and the old,
There's a lot I miss, as the Pandora's boxes unfold.

Maybe it's a big 'L', from the elements we call life,
Maybe it's a ghost of the dead weight, my dreams, your heart- a knife.

Well on my way to oblivion, as I join the corners of my hurting spleen,
The pain dwindles into the dark, as I am forgetting on Opiate, how everything feels.

The opiate of love, forgetting and longing,
The subtle art of mourning and grieving,
It's all gone, to the mystical corners of a river,
Whose name flows in 'L' and parks in curves,
Maybe, I am also hard-forgetting how to swim or surf.

No wonder it's true, I wake in the midst of night,
Drenched in sweat, cold, looking for a book on war and love.
No wonder the moon seems to have drifted so far,
No wonder I am forgetting the name of the love book, I remembered by heart.
