The One shadow in the longest queue
The One with shades of despondent blues,
The One who never wishes to be greeted
The One who is often mistreated,

She is Durga, Sati, Radha or Mary
She bores the fruit and warms in her aery,
She is THE ONE, THE ONE Unsung
She is raped, killed and cruelly hung,

The One who is traded for money and gold
The One who never fails you, even when she is old,
She is worshiped, looked up for wisdom and mercy
She shows you compassion, herself pursing,

She is a mother, a daughter, a sister, a friend
She is devastated, but happily lends,
She is the One who is asset-promoted
She is also the One who is often looted,

She isn't scared, but fierce in her dreams
A kingdom, a palace, an army, she bleeds,
She is sleeping, weeping in her bore
Wait my friend, you will now hear her ROAR!
