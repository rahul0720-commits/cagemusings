My memory stops to fail me,
As I remember, how I 'looked',
My captors said, they fell in love,
With a walking hurricane,
Fleeting letters and storms of words.

How beautifully, often graceless,
Putting a face, to heartache, a name,
Cooing war inside her brain,
Never they thought they'd love her the same.

For her fractured pieces,
Could still make, born art,
Like polished sheets and fine creases,
A muse, to her, was all their part.

Walking, not her forte, never the case,
Running away a daily chore,
Many places to stray, no permanent base,
Ambush, alone didn't bore.

But what could cure this mistake?
A choker chain,
Made of self-restraint,
Were worn by this 'Runaway Train',
She is a runaway train...
