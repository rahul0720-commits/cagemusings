excerpt: "A meditation on the stillness between day and night."

The light retreats behind the rooftops,
leaving shadows soft as breath.
I sit with nothing but the clock,
its ticking louder than my thoughts.

The tea grows cold. The page stays blank.
And yet, this hour is never wasted —
this pause between the noise,
this quiet that the world forgot.
