Somewhere lurking in the corner of my mind,
I have always known your mellow knocks, every now and then,
As I wander aloof in the dark allies with my blinds,
My heart frantically races the when.

The when and the how, will I lose a string and fall backwards in time.
I tried to hide you under the mountains I climb,
I tried to burry you deep, under the oceans I drenched my feet in,
I tried to eat you whole when I needed a mouthful,
I tried to run away when my feet longed the Tuscan Earth.

The outcome has been the same,
My juvenile attempts to build a sanatorium for my bona fides, all in vain.
The nearest I have tasted your essence is while embracing the goriest thoughts,
You bestow upon me.

But now I know, the things I know,
When my mountains of pain and longing will be won,
When there's no space and conjecture of points left to turn,
When I feel the last gush of the wind on my face,
You shall see me with open arms, an end to circling in maze.

Now, as I recede from the peak,
As I come back to my set routine,
The legitimacy of my sanity dwindles into darkness.
As I settle in, it leaves me be,
My usual claustrophobic self takes over.

There's no guarantee, no warrant and no remedy.
A loop, our social weaving.
Which all living 'is' to endure, till our time comes and we are ONE,
One with Nature, from dust to dust and ashes to ashes.
That's how the mass fabric is spun.
