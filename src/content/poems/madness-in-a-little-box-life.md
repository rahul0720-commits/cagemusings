The Madonna of pain, madness of a butterfly
Sister of the moon, daughter of the sky
The dance of the morning, a chance of the wild
The whispers of darkness, the cruelty of the child

A Zenith of a man, shallows of his cry
Stories of fear and memoirs of a toy
Incense of a tear, his flames of joy
Grips that bore his soul
Strings who freed his whole

And all that makes a mad man sigh
Are all born from your roving eye
So go take the universe along your beat
Go put anklets in your feet

Feel the wind caressing your freedom
Let it take away your demons
Go, the stars will be your mirror
And they'll fire your passion's quiver
The breeze will dance with you
And the love shall always remain true...
